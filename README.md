# Flask Power Consumption Chart
Fetches data from Power Automate which gets the daily data from an email.

My first python web project using flask and REST API.

Basically fetches data from DB with a GET request. Then displays the data in a table.

As in the project name "Chart" you're also able to view these data in a chart using Chart.js
